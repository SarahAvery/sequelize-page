              An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that allows us
              to make queries and manipulate data in a relational database, like
              MySQL, and Postgres. ORM’s convert database queries into
              JavaScript objects, which we can then use.

              Sequelize is an open-source Node.js module that allows you to
              interact directly with an object in JavaScript.

              In our case, we will be talking about using Sequelize with
              Postgres. You will need to install Sequelize, and Sequelize-cli.
            </p>
            <code>npm install sequelize sequelize-cli</code>
            <p class="para">
              Sequelize is the Sequelize library itself, and Sequelize-cli is a
              package that allows us to interact with the database through
              Sequelize from the CLI.

              To set up Sequelize, you must first establish a connection to the
              database. Keeping the ‘S’ capitalized because it is a class. Then
              create a new instance of the Sequelize class, passing in options.
              Then export Sequelize so we can use it in our models.

              “Models are the essence of Sequelize. A model is an abstraction
              that represents a table in your database. In Sequelize, it is a
              class that extends Model.
            </p>

            <p class="para">
              The model tells Sequelize several things about the entity it
              represents, such as the name of the table in the database and
              which columns it has (and their data types).”.

              Here is a Customer model, which is our first entity in our
              database. We are mapping sequel tables into JavaScript objects. To
              create a customer table, we need to define our fields in the model
              by using <span class="method">sequelize.define()</span>. Define
              can take in three parameters the table name, attributes, and
              options. In our case below, we are only focusing on our table
              name, and attributes.

              We name our table <em>customer</em>, and we map our object fields.
              The first field is <em>id</em>, and it has the type integer. It
              will automatically increment the id number for each new customer
              that is added to the database. The id can not be null, and the id
              is the primary key for this table.

            <p class="para">
              Sequelize provides a sync method for us to synchronize all of our
              tables. When we defined the models we used the same Sequelize

            </p>

            <p class="para">
              There can be four (4) different type of associations that can be

              Sequelize will automatically create a foreign key called
              customerId in the order table.

              When we run <code>node index.js</code> again, we will notice no

              <span class="method">.sync()</span>, and the relationship was not
              defined at the time of creation. Instead, we will need to use
              force sync. Inside our sync method, we need to add an object with
              the key of <em>force</em>, and a value of <em>true</em>. This will
              drop any tables that already exist, and recreate them with any
              information or data that was updated, like adding our
              relationship.

              Using Sequelize, gives us a very clear schema, and this allows it
              to be changed very easily as well. The models are very strict in
              how to be written, which guarantees that everyone follows the same
              standardization. By learning Sequelize, we do not have to make raw
              SQL queries, and can write our queries in plain JavaScript.
