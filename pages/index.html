              An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that allows us
              to make queries and manipulate data in a relational database, like
              MySQL, and Postgres. ORM’s convert database queries into
              JavaScript objects, which we can then use.

              In our case, we will be talking about using Sequelize with

            <code>npm install sequelize sequelize-cli</code>
            <p class="para">
              Sequelize is the Sequelize library itself, and Sequelize-cli is a
              package that allows us to interact with the database through
              Sequelize from the CLI.

              create a new instance of the Sequelize class, passing in options.
              Then export Sequelize so we can use it in our models.

              Here is a Customer model, which is our first entity in our
              database. We are mapping SQL tables into JavaScript objects. To
              create a customer table, we need to define our fields in the model
              by using <span class="method">sequelize.define()</span>. Define
              can take in three parameters, the table name, attributes, and

              Sequelize provides a sync method for us to synchronize all of our

              defined at the time of creation. Instead, we will need to use
              force sync. Inside our sync method, we need to add an object with
              the key of <em>force</em>, and a value of <em>true</em>. This will
              drop any tables that already exist, and recreate them with any

              Using Sequelize, gives us a very clear schema, and this allows it
              to be changed very easily as well. The models are very strict in
              how to be written, which guarantees that everyone follows the same
              standardization. By learning Sequelize, we do not have to make raw
              SQL queries, and can write our queries in plain JavaScript.
